Tabletop Simulator - Space Base

When I tried playing a Space Base game on Tabletop Simulator with my friends, we got about halfway through and realized the game was super buggy. We managed to finish, but I decided to check out the code and see if I could quickly fix some bugs. That lead to me rewriting almost all of this mod as well as adding expansions and more functionality.

The original mod was created by DocWily. I reduced the code size by over 90%. My version still uses the Dice Roller by Mr. Stump, which is mostly unchanged.
